# iCryptr
An iOS app that performs AES256 encryption on device utilizing Apple's [CommonCrypto](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/) encryption library written in C. The app allows users to pick files from the Files app or photos/videos from the Photos app and encrypt them in custom file format.


#### Note
This is a complete overhaul of my original [iCryptr](https://github.com/IAmBrendanL/iCryptr) project which was a document-based app that could not handle large files.
